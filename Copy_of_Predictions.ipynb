              " 'Well, let me try to help. I\\'m not a psychologist, psychiatrist or health professional of aky kind, but I have experienced different levels of depression through the last few years, and maybe that qualifies me to provide you some input.\\n\\nThe main issue when trying to explain depression is simply the fact that the word \"depression\" is widely missused to identify \"sadness\". People say \"I\\'m depressed\" when, in fact, what they are experiencing is a normal reaction to a bad situation, such as the loss of a loved one or the end of a relationship.\\n\\nDepression is NOT sadness. Far from it. Actually, if you are sad, and can pinpoint the cause of your sadness, you are not likely to be depressed. In my experience, the word that most accurately describes depression is \"numbness\".\\n\\nYou know when you spend too much time lying on your arm, or too long sitting with your elbows against your knees, and you arm/leg \"falls asleep\"? That\\'s depression, but instead of not feeling anything in your arms or legs, you don\\'t feel any propper emotion. That\\'s why sometimes people DO get depressed after a specially traumatic event, just like your limbs get numb after too much pressure on a certain point. The parts of you that are responsible for feeling certain things simply fail to do so. They \"fall asleep\".\\n\\nDepressed people are usually seen as \"sad\" by others for the simple fact that they are not feeling anything and, therefore, show no signs of stimulation. You tell them something that should be really heartbreaking and they reply with a simple \"yeah, I know, that sucks\", because for them no emotional response was triggered by the information you just provided. It\\'s just like poking a numb limb with a toothpick, and assuming that it is dead because it didnt jerk or twitch or cause that person to say \"ouch\". It is not dead, its just not feeling that poke.\\n\\nThat is tremendously hard to explain to other people for another very simple reason: your subjective experience of life cannot be shared with others. There is no way to do it, no way you can explain someone how the color red looks to you without resorting to some sort of comparisson (\"red is the color of tomatoes and Super Mario\\'s hat!\"), which is a technique that doesnt really work since there is no way to tell if the other person sees tomatoes and Super Mario the same way that you do. Maybe the way I see the color of a tomato is, for you, what you would call green. There is no way to know.\\n\\nSo when your spouse sees your actions and perceives them as a sign of you being sad, he is naturally going to assume that it should be easy to fix by simply doing something fun and chasing the sadness away. He is failing to realize that you cannot experience the sensation of \"something fun\", because the parts of you that are responsible for feeling that are \"asleep\". And when you tell him \"this is not sadness, it is depression!\", what he hears is \"this is not sadness, it is sadness!\", since the word is so widely missused. And then he does something that should make you feel better if you were just sad, but you don\\'t, and he assumes that you simply refuse to feel better, because he can\\'t experience what you are experiencing.\\n\\nTry and get your spouse to do some reading about depression, and ask him to give you some credit and believe that what you feel is different than what he feels. If he is a reasonable guy, he\\'ll get it eventually.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'m sorry you\\'re feeling that way. Its a terrible thing, and it kind of feeds itself be keeping you away from the world. The more depressed you are, the less appealing the world seems to you and you end up doing less and less things, which gets you deeper and deeper into depression. But there is one thing your spouse is right about: you do have to do something about it. It feels wrong, it feels like nothing is going to help because you never feel anything anyway, but you need to look for help, maybe get a therapist, maybe get medicated. \\n\\nThink of it like getting up in the morning to go out for a jog - it feels terrible to do it, and once you do get to it you dont feel any thinner. But if you keep at it, keep doing it even though you are tired or sleepy or lazy, you WILL get thinner, you WILL feel less and less lazy, and it WILL be better for you.\\n\\nTL;DR: Depression is a numbness of the mind, and you cant explain that to people because nobody REALLY understands how another person feels, subjectivelly. Depression is not sadness, it is failure to properly perceive stimulation.\\n\\n(BTW, English is not my first language, so please forgive any grammar mistakes)',\n",

I'll go over two below:\\n\\n###PWM\\nPWM, or Pulse Width Modulation, makes the assumption that the average voltage over a wire is just as good as any instantaneous voltage. The voltage is switched on and off really fast and the duty cycle, or percentage of the time the voltage is on, multiplied by the peak voltage is equivalent to the average voltage over a wire.\\n\\n###Resistor Ladders\\nResistor ladders are how digital to analog converters work along with analog video signals such as VGA. The same voltage is fed into a bunch of resistors, each individual resistor's source controlled by a digital logic. The voltage out of each resistor added up is equivalent to the output voltage. The advantage of this technique is that it does not rely on average voltage but rather the instantaneous voltage. It is, however, limited in resolution (number of possible voltages) by the size of the resistor ladder whereas PWM is limited by a timer on a microprocessor.\",\n",

By nature, countries will compete for dominance over one another for political, economic, and security reasons. Therefore this state is almost unattainable. Not all countries can afford or care to keep up with the others, so there will never be a time when no country is more powerful than others. \\n\\nNow for the middle state, *multiple superpowers*. This is what the cold war was. This ends up the same as we discussed above, because the countries that CAN afford to compete for power DO compete, and end up in 'cold' wars with one another. This can happen with any number of countries, for instance during the last half of the 20th century it was two (US and USSR), but it could easily happen with three, four, or more countries competing for dominance.\\n\\nFirst on this list is close to what we have now, *one superpower*. The united states 'won' the cold war because the other guy quit competing. That left it with no other country even CLOSE to being as powerful militarily or spending as much as they did. \\n\\nHere they had two options: stop spending because our main threat is 'gone', or keep spending to PREVENT them from being able to come back. The US chose the latter, obviously. Many people think that a system of one superpower is the most realistic 'best' option. It is unrealistic to think that countries will not compete with each other, and a cold war is dangerous for the entire planet because nuclear arms exist. \\n\\nThe theory is this: If the US spends so much money and has such a large military presence in most of the world that they can counter any emerging threats before they get too big, that *theoretically* means that other countries would have a hard time becoming powerful enough to inflict major harm on other countries because the US *could* swoop in at any time and stop them. While the US is not a perfect country, most of the world (the west and some of Asia) thinks that the US is a good choice because *the other candidates are worse*. Russia? Most of the world doesn't want them to have the power. China? Same thing. Both have terrible human rights records and less obligation to do things fairly because they don't answer to their citizens in the same way. While the US doesn't do things fairly or always do the 'right' thing, it's pretty much the only candidate for the job that has a *chance* of doing the right thing. \\n\\nAncillary reasons: With the US military being so large and powerful, many Europeans countries can spend WAY less money per capita on their military. This is good for them. Part of the reason the US spends more than the next 13 countries combined is because they hardly spend anything at all since they either can't keep up enough to matter against the US military or they are friends with the US.\\n\\nThe US spends a lot but we have for all of recent memory so the citizens don't put up much fuss. It also helps that having the most powerful military in the world allows you to exert your will on other countries for political, economic, or security reasons.\",\n",

              " 'Nuclear warheads fitted to ICBM\\'s and SLBM\\'s are not really warheads in the same sense as an artillery round. They are in fact a small and complex machine fitted inside a heat resistant and aerodynamic shell. It might be easier to think of them as miniature spacecraft. One nuclear missile will carry several warheads and they will seperate to attack different targets or the same target multiple times. These are called MIRV or Multiple Independent Re-Entry Vehicle.\\n\\nBecause they are basically machines, they are designed to be taken apart and maintained. The pit or the nuclear element of the warhead is just one component. It can be removed and in fact very often is removed from the warhead for things like testing (Where it is replaced by an inert device) and routine maintenance.\\n\\nThe decommissioning process varies depending on the terms of the treaty. In some cases it is simply a case of reducing the number of MIRV\\'s the missile carries say from 12 to 8. If physical removal is required it is a case of removing the nuclear element of the warhead and putting it into storage or use as a fuel, while recycling or destroying the components of the MIRV. The missiles themselves are rarely destroyed in entirety, they or their components often have useful secondary peaceful applications.\\n\\nThere are a number of common misconceptions about ICBM\\'s, SLBM\\'s and nuclear warheads and their MIRV delivery system. One is that their guidance components use GPS to guide them into their targets. This is in fact not true. These missiles must reach their target and relying on GPS might harm their chances of that happening if the GPS system where to be attacked. So the majority of ICBM/SLBM use celestial navigation (The positions of the stars) to guide them into their targets. They don\\'t have to be super accurate. A circular error of probability of half a mile is acceptable. Russian missiles used to have massive payloads to make up for their less accurate guidance systems. It really doesn\\'t matter if your off target by 3 miles if you ramp up the explosive power by 10 megatons! For this reason you will often see US missiles use smaller warheads than their russian counterparts.\\n\\nAnother common misconception is that the warheads have some communication component that offers an ability to communicate with it after launch and give a recall or cancellation ability, so if a missile is fired in some sort of accidental launch scenario it can be communicated with and made inert or to blow itself up without going nuclear. This is also not true and is a myth perpetrated by Hollywood. The risks of an enemy finding out how to communicate with the missile and destroy it would be too great. These weapons are designed to be the ultimate and last deterrent. The missile, once fired, communicates with nothing and no-one. It is a self contained system that once the button has been pressed, will carry out it\\'s mission to it\\'s final horrifying end unless it is somehow intercepted externally.\\n\\n---\\n\\nEDIT: Clarified decommissioning process and celestial navigation and the fact I may not have mentioned inertial guidance clearly enough. To clarify the correct term is astro-inertial guidance in that the \"majority\" of ICBM\\'s and SLBM\\'s (Lest we not forget the US developed versions are not the only types of these horrific weapons) use both, with inertial guidance being responsible for initial and re-entry guidance and celestial for mid course correction. \\n\\nSo celestial navigation is the tracking of your position by looking at where you are in relation to the stars, because where you are and the time of day defines what you can see and where they should be in the night sky. It\\'s not an overly complex skill and we have been doing it for a very long time. It\\'s kind of fallen out of use in these days of GPS. Ships at sea would use a sextant to help them plot their position relative to the time of the day and the position of the stars which was why getting accurate clocks on board ships was such a big deal many years ago. In fact the earliest Boeing 747 aircraft had a porthole in their cockpit roofs to allow the crew to use celestial navigation should the need arise!\\n\\nObviously celestial navigation is of more use at night and in good weather if your on the ground, but ICBM\\'s and SLBM\\'s don\\'t need to worry about this as within the space of about 30 seconds they are high enough to begin using it without either of these concerns as they use inertial guidance in their initial launch. The missile and MIRV\\'s basically have a digital version of a sextant on board. If you would like to see a vaguely similar approximation of how they work, I suggest you download the [Sky app \\\\(Formerly Google Sky\\\\)](_URL_0_), which allows you to use your phone to plot the stars in the sky (Though Google augments this with GPS data so they cheat a little bit).',\n",

X now has half his chromosomes from you, and the other half from his mother, who is Y, but she has half of *her* chromosomes from you, so about half of X's chromosomes from Y are actually yours, too.\\n\\nAll of a sudden it becomes much more likely that X has at least one pair of identical chromosomes. And that's bad, because it means that damaged genes on one of the chromosomes are also damaged on the other.\\n\\nSo inbreeding actually increases the probability that *problems that are already there* will become apparent. If you don't have any damaged genes, inbreeding is fine. (Actually there are other problems too, but they are not as critical.)\\n\\nSo when you isolate a bunch of people and they have to start inbreeding (because there simply aren't enough), there will be problems for a while until evolution can clean up the genetic pool. Basically large populations can support more bad genes, and the human population is quite large indeed.\",\n",

              " 'Big question. But here we go!\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve is the United States\\' \\'central bank,\\' which basically means that it is just like a normal bank--except it has this totally awesome extra power that no other organization (bank or otherwise) in the United States can have (according to [Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution](_URL_0_)): it can create money. To keep this ELI5, I won\\'t explain monetary policy or anything like that beyond just to say how the Fed does this and why.\\n\\nThere are a couple of big functions of the Fed, and all of them focus on one of the Fed\\'s two \"Dual Mandates\" (or, arguably, a third goal I\\'ll explain in a second). The Dual Mandates are to create fiscal policies that promote \"maximum employment\" (meaning \\'as many people have jobs as possible\\') or \"controlled inflation\" (meaning \\'prices don\\'t rise out of control\\'). If you don\\'t know much about economics, cover your ears because I\\'m going to spoil Macroeconomics 101 for you: you can\\'t give everyone jobs AND have low inflation. Employment and inflation are tied together: when one goes up, so does the other. The \"Dual Mandate\" is really just a way to articulate the third, over-arching goal: to keep the economy *stable*. To not let one rise so much that it causes the other to get out of whack. So that\\'s why the Fed does everything it does: either to control unemployment, or to control inflation but *always* to keep the economy stable.\\n\\nSo--what does the Fed do?\\n\\n- It\\'s the \"bank\\'s bank.\" This came into play a lot during the bank bailouts, which I\\'ll get to in a second, but it also has a more routine effect on the economy too: under the Fed is a system called the Check Clearing System. I won\\'t get into how it works, because it\\'s needlessly complicated for our purposes, but the important thing is that before it came around, when times were economically rough, your bank might not accept a check that I wrote to you from my account at my bank. Banks couldn\\'t be sure the money was in my account, and they didn\\'t want to have to sue my bank to get the money, and they didn\\'t want to piss you off by putting money in your account and then having to remove it when it turned out that my check wasn\\'t good. So the Fed acts as a neutral go-between between the banks involved in a check transaction (which is why checks take a couple of days to clear), and the result is that if you write a check to somebody--no matter where they do their banking--they\\'ll be able to cash it. \\n\\n- It can give banks huge sums of money very quickly. This, of course, sounds like a bad idea. But remember: one of the goals the Fed has is to keep the economy stable. And if banks stop trusting that other banks have enough money to pay them, they will clam up and stop doing business with them, which will stop the economy in its tracks. So if it looks like a huge bank might go bust because it can\\'t borrow enough to cover its debts, the Fed can become the \"Lender of Last Resort,\" which basically just means that...\\n\\n- It can create money. This is probably the most powerful thing the Fed can do because it violates every rule about money there is. If you want to get $10 to buy something, you need to get it from someone else, but that person had to get it from someone, and that someone had to get it from someone else, and so on. Everybody gets money from someone--but not the Fed. The Fed is the first step in this chain: it made that $10 out of thin air. You asked earlier how the Fed works with banks, and this is a big way: part of the way that Check Clearing System I mentioned earlier works is that each bank that participates in it (which is pretty much all of them, because why would you want to open an account with a bank you can\\'t take other banks\\' checks to?) has an account with the Federal Reserve (which is not unlike your account at your bank in that it has a account balance). Now, the Fed can create money in two ways: it can walk over to a Federal Mint (like the ones in Philadelphia or San Fransisco) and literally ask them to print the amount of money it wants, or it can go into the accounts banks have with the Fed and change the amount of money in the account to a higher number. When banks wake up the next morning and see that they have more money than they thought, they\\'ll immediately start lending it out (because banks want to lend money--it\\'s how *they* make money!) and that gets the economy\\'s gears moving. Using this second way, the Fed can create and move huge sums--trillions of dollars--*in just a few minutes*. The fact that the Fed can magically save a bank before it goes under can be used to avert a bank panic--which is one of the forces which worsened the Great Depression, and, again, this all speaks to the Fed\\'s goal to keep the economy stable.\\n\\n- It can set interest rates. Most of the time, when the Fed creates money, it lends it out to banks. So say the Fed decides to create $1 billion today. It says to a couple of banks \"you can have this money, but you have to pay me back at 3% interest.\" The banks say \"Sure! I\\'ll borrow it from you, and then turn around and lend it to my customers at 5% and keep the profits!\" And then the Fed would add the money to the bank\\'s account. Bam! $1 billion created. The Fed can affect interest rates throughout the entire country by raising and lowering the interest rate it offers banks, because banks will lend at the lowest rate they can function at (because otherwise, you, the customer, would go to a bank that offers a lower rate and the bank misses out on getting interest from you), so the Fed can directly affect the interest rate you get on your home or car loan or your student loan--or whatever sort of loan you went to your bank to get just by affecting the \"overhead\" cost the bank has to pay to get the money in the first place.\\n\\nThese last two monetary powers are big ones because they can be used to target those Dual Mandates. If it prints lots of money, the banks will lend it out and people will use that to hire new employees--that lowers unemployment but it also artificially increased the money supply so each dollar is \"worth\" less (which is just another way to think about what inflation is).\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of math and economics that go into when the Fed uses any of these things, but it isn\\'t really necessary to know about the specifics to understand why the Fed does what it does unless you want to know why it chose to create the *amount* of money it did, or why it chose a *specific* bank to loan to, etc.',\n",

Many of these empires developed, for their time, very advanced technology, but all of these empires inevitably collapsed and much of that technology was then lost. Only very recently (as far as human history is concerned) has Europe held such dominance in technology. It should also be noted that Europe rose to power in the form of Rome and Macedonia, but also collapsed into the Dark Ages before re-rising to power in the modern context.

Cellulose molecules bristle with hydroxyl (OH) groups, and these form hydrogen bonds with each other. It's these hydrogen bonds that make the individual fibres stiff, and also hold the fibres together.\\n\\nWater is also full of OH bonds, obviously since it's H22O, and the water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose, which breaks the hydrogen bonds that cellulose molecules form with each other. There are two results from this: firstly the cellulose fibes in the paper become floppy, because their internal hydrogen bonds are broken, and secondly the fibres separate from each other more easily. The combination of these two effects makes paper easier to tear apart when wet.\\n\\nMost organic materials show similar behaviour. For example cotton is also easier to tear when wet (cotton is also made mostly from cellulose).

It's very cheap and simple to add to the water supply, and it's harmless in reasonable quantities. Fluoride is also present in toothpastes and mouthwashes for this reason. So governments around the world decided to add it to the public water supply, protecting every person's teeth and reducing pain, medical costs, disease, etc for little cost and effort. It also strengthens bones generally and protects against things like osteoporosis, although the doses in public water supplies are so low that this isn't a very pronounced effect -- usually your doctor would give you much higher doses if you needed that protection. \\n\\nFluoride at high doses can be dangerous. Fatal dosages for adults begin at around 5 grams, which is equivalent to about 5,000 litres/1,320 gallons of normally fluoridated water in one day (note the 'begins' -- if you are an 80kg/180lb man it would be about double this). At lower doses, it can cause swelling and pain in joints. Fluoride does occur naturally in many groundwater supplies, sometimes at doses high enough to cause that swelling and pain (around 20 - 30x the dose normally used in public water supplies).\\n\\nSome people found it scary that the government would add something to the water supply, and the idea that fluoride is actually used to make people passive, brainwashable, etc is a popular conspiracy theory.

To determine how much nitrogen is in it, they use a chemical technique called Kjeldahl analysis which tells you how much nitrogen is in the sample. That's proportional to the amount of amino acids, meaning you can figure rout how much protein was in the sample - and they look up on a table (calculated 100 years ago) how many calories there are per unit of protein (originally figured out in a calorimeter by burning proteins).\\n\\nFor fats, there are similar methods (using hexane instead of an acid to separate it out), and the fats have a known caloric content too. Everything left-over, calorically, is carbohydrate - again, they look on a chart to see how much a carbohydrate is worth.\\n\\nThere are a battery of tests for the presence of various vitamins and minerals. Some involve chromatography (separating the chemicals out by how they move along a film, through a chemical gradient, or by size of the molecule). Some can be done by mass spectroscopy (vaporize a sample and hurl the atoms down a tube where magnets deflect the atoms based on mass and electrostatic charge)…\\n\\nThe key, though, is that it's really expensive to do all of these chemical tests. So, rather than do them over and over, one does it to each ingredient in the product, and you fetch the values for each ingredient in a database and work out how much of ingredient you used and calculate out the calories, fats, carbs, protein, etc. that way. Necessarily, it's a gross approximation: not all fruit has the same sugar content, grains very in how much fiber vs. starch they have, but the expectation is that in the long run, the numbers on the package represent the average nutritional content one would find given the ingredients used.\",\n",
              " 'The Dalai Lama is a highly influential figure in Tibetan Buddhism. He is considered an enlightened being, who reincarnated by will. Short excourse: In buddhism, the ultimate goal is to achieve enlightenment and break the cycle of death and rebirth. The Dalai Lama achieved enlightenment but still returned in order to help other people.\\nIn Tibetan Buddhism people who are enlightened and returned are considered something similar to patron saints.\\n\\nThe Dalai Lama is the head of the Tibetan government in exile (Tibet is still occupied by China) and is the highest teacher in Tibetan Buddhism.\\n\\nImportant to note is that the Dalai Lama is not chosen or elected, but *found*. Buddhism believes in reincarnation so every Dalai Lama is considered the same being. You cannot become the Dalai Lama, you are found out to **be** the Dalai Lama.\\n\\nHe is found by the highest lamas (priests) with extra authority given to the so called panchen lama. The panchen lama is also a reincarnated being that has been found by the highest lamas and the current dalai lama.\\n\\nNow, the current problem is that the current panchen lama went missing 20 years ago, possibly abducted by the Chinese government. The Chinese claim that he is fine and just camera-shy, but this is met with ... scepticism.\\nThe whole point is that the Chinese would love the next Dalai Lama to be pro-China and would officially recognise Chinese rule over Tibet. So it is possible that the Chinese government abducted the panchen lama and either replaced him with somebody loyal to the Party, or indoctrinated him.\\n\\nSo the current Dalai Lama suggested that he might not reincarnate again, because \"he is no longer needed\" which is probably just a theological excuse to keep the Tibetan government in exile active. The Chinese government (officially atheist, by the way) refused this and said that the Dalai Lama has no choice over whether he will reincarnate or not. \\n\\nWhen the current Dalai Lama dies, it is feared that this might split Tibetan Buddhism between those who support the Chinese Panchen Lama and those who either support the Dalai Lama found by the government in exile or who believe this Dalai Lama was the last.\\n\\nIf this sounds weird, well welcome to the world where religion and politics meet.',\n",
              " 'There are different acting methods and ways of viewing the craft, so it\\'s going to vary a little from actor to actor. I can only speak as someone who did a couple shows in high school, and who played characters who had varying skill in lying or not lying for what worked for me. If I were better researched on the craft I could tell you about the techniques professionals use, but I noped out of the field after high school, research and all. \\n\\nThe technique I used--which was mostly just me doing the same play-pretend stuff I did as a kid encouraged by \"Wow Carly, you\\'re such a good actor! Maybe you\\'ll go to hollywood when you grow up!\"--was that I tried to pretend I actually was the character and think and feel the way they felt. This was natural to me because I spent a lot of time writing stories and playing pretend as a kid, and I watched a lot of TV and had memorized a lot of the little visual things actors do to get something across. But I would just be constantly thinking about the lines, about what happened to the character before, and about how they felt now, what they were planning. And I guess my body language and voice just kinda changed to match what I was \"feeling.\" \\n\\nIn two of the plays I was in, I had to play characters who tell very big lies that screw up everything for everyone else in the play. One of the characters was a good liar, and one was a bad liar. In real life, I\\'m actually an awful liar because I\\'m not very well practiced. My good liar, though? She had a plan and she knew exactly how to pull it off, so I knew she\\'d be confident, and I know she\\'s literally did not care what it did to anyone else. I focused on what she would be feeling, on the confidence and poise and the smug satisfaction of \"you stupid SOBS have no idea\" she had going on.\\n\\nMy bad liar was really upset, and told the lie just for spite. It was so, so obviously untrue that I cannot believe any version of the character she lied to believed it. I just stayed in the place she was in, which was more or less \"HAHAHAHA TAKE THAT\" and delivered the line with the over the top rage that motivated it instead of the more restrained bitterness or even angry sympathy that would have been called for if the line were true. The character she was lying to is dumb as a box of rocks and the audience knew I was lying, so really any emotionally inappropriate delivery would have flown there. I could have acted super happy, super sad, anything extreme... as long as it wasn\\'t subtle or normal or right.\\n\\nSo TLDR, in my case, I was really good at convincing myself for a little bit that I was the character and imagining how they felt and what exactly they were thinking. If I had to lie well, I had them engage in the same process. If I had to lie badly, I focused on what they were feeling instead of what the lie should have made them feel, and maybe cranked it up just a little bit past what felt right to me. Actors who use a different process would have a different way of doing it, but the net \"output\" of having the character not act the way the actor feels like the audience would expect for a \"good\" performance is gonna stay the same in many cases.',\n",

First, make sure there is nothing in front of your car.  Get in the car and get comfy.  Make sure ALL electrical stuff in the car (radio, heater, wipers, etc) are OFF.   Push brake pedal.  Push the clutch in. Release parking brake.  Make sure your transmission is in NEUTRAL (not in gear)  Turn the key to the ON position! This step is often forgotten but is obviously important!   Release the brake a bit...make sure the car can roll a bit and you can turn the steering wheel.   Now stop.  Ok.  Here we go.  Put the shifter into FIRST GEAR. KEEP THE CLUTCH PUSHED IN. Release the brake and let the car roll... to a walking pace. Now, let go of the clutch and let it catch. The engine should now turn over and the car should start. You want to pay careful attention when it catches...give it a bit of gas and so on.  Be sure to STOP right away and let the car warm up a bit...but DON'T TURN IT OFF as you need to let it charge the battery.   NOTE: This also works in REVERSE.

[Here](_URL_1_) is a quick example of increasing a game's FOV I googled up. The image on the left has the FOV expanded to 65 degrees compared to the default of 45 degrees on the left. With the larger FOV you can see more on the left and right.

The opposite is also true, if you decrease the FOV then it increases the apparent size of far away objects since they now converge on a larger portion of the view area. The camera on DSCOVR used to take these pictures has a FOV of just 0.61°. It makes it very effective at collecting light from far away objects because it is focused on a very small cone.

Both deal with the mechanics of sound, while one focuses on the psychology of “how” you hear, more precisely than merely “what” you hear. \\n\\n1.) Constant noise that has a relatively small amount of randomness within its pitch variation, produces what is called “Brown” noise. The name comes from Robert Brown, the scientist who became known for his work in discovering Brownian motion (particle physics). The addition of slight, context-dependent randomness is the mathematical component that was novel within his work. Each pitch is found by adding a random offset to the pitch before it, creating a sort-of upper and lower bound for the pitch to fall within, without it wandering off by accident. This noise, which has a frequency equivalent to the the reciprocal square of its energetic component (dB = 1/f^2), is stronger at lower frequencies. That makes the dull roar much louder, and encompasses enough of the audible sound spectrum to drown out a lot of bass-heavy frequencies (sounds of highways, etc). The sound dilution is, I think, what effect waterfalls or rainfall often have in terms of drowning out other noise (excuse the pun) and thereby creating a sense of comfort without intrusion from the environment... \\n\\n2.) If you really care to figure out what, beyond the sound, is happening with uniform fields of sound, light, etc... check out some writings on the Ganzfeld experiment.  The experiment involves prolonged and absolute exposure to uniform fields of color at a fixed depth, and usually a uniform field of sound as well. Interestingly, people begin to see and hear things that are due solely to their mind attempting to discern how far away the sound they are hearing, or sight they are seeing, is.  It follows that people often find the noise used in Ganzfeld experiments (white, pink, brown noise) as having an enhancing effect on concentration and creativity.  While this could play a part in calming someone, it may just as well result in someone’s mind becoming restless given too much time or space to think.\\n\\nHopefully, some of that answers your question and isn’t too far above 5 years for this sub. :)',\n",

Energy can come from carbohydrates (sugar is a carb), protein, or fat.  \\n\\nCarbs are sort of the most basic way of storing energy in a living thing.  They include sugar which your body can use for energy really easily and starch.  Starch, (sometimes called a complex carb) is one of the main ways that plants store food for later.  It is not a lot more complicated than a bunch of sugar stuck on end so your body can turn it into sugar to use pretty easily.  If you chew on something starchy like a pretzel or a dry noodle it will start to taste sweet.  There are also *more* complex carbs like fiber that your body can't use for energy but are good for you for other reasons.  \\n\\nProtein is not made out of sugar and is more complicated than sugar.  It can be used for energy like sugar but is a little more difficult for your body to use so you get a little less energy out of the same amount of protein compared to sugar or other carbs.  Protein is also the stuff that you are made out of so you need to eat some of it even if you have enough carbs to use for energy.  You don't need that much protein though even if you are growing fast or building muscle so a regular western diet should have more than enough protein in it.  A lot of it will just be used for energy instead of making stuff in your body.\\n\\nFat or oil is a way that plants and animals store energy.

The hard part is controlling how much your body wants to eat and sugar and fat have a lot to do with that.

              " 'The medical and science communities are still not sure exactly *why*, or what causes our bodies to flag something as an invader that it previously hasn\\'t. When we develop an allergy can be affected by many variables, including genetics. If you have an allergy prone parent, you\\'re 40% more likely to develop allergies. If both of your parents have allergies, you\\'re 70% more likely. However, you may not have the same allergies they do. \\n\\nAllergies are a response of the immune system to what it sees as an invader. The circumstances have to be just right for the allergen to trigger an allergic reaction, so the first time you\\'re exposed to cats you may be fine. The 17th time, you may be fine. The 70th time, you may be fine...but then the 71st time you have a reaction. It begins with exposure. Even if you\\'ve inhaled an allergen many times before with no trouble, at some point, for some reason, the body flags it as an invader. During this particular exposure, the immune system studies the allergen. It readies itself for the next exposure by developing antibodies, special cells designed to detect it. You are now \"sensitized\" to the allergen.\\n\\nThen, the next time you\\'re exposed to the allergen, your immune system kicks into action. The antibodies recognize it. That triggers the activation of special cells called mast cells. These cells are responsible for the symptoms in the lungs, skin, mucosal linings of the sinus and intestinal tract. These mast cells burst open, releasing something called histamines. You may have noticed allergy medications called anti-histamines. These are meant to block these histamines, thus alleviating the symptoms they cause. \\n\\nThe amount of exposure matters as well. If you\\'re allergic to, say, strawberries or avocado, you may not have a problem with a spoonful of guac or a berry or two. But then you eat a third berry, or another chip with guac, and you notice your eyes watering and itching, or perhaps hives raising on your arms, or even begin having difficulty taking a deep breath. This is because histamines cause inflammation. \\n\\nSometimes you outgrow an allergy. And sometimes people don\\'t react as strongly to the allergens that have given them problems in the past as they age. It\\'s thought this is perhaps because our immune systems weaken as we age and therefore doesn\\'t produce as strong of a response. But they never go away on their own. And some allergies will get worse over time...especially true with things like latex allergies and allergies to bee stings. There are also cross-affective allergies, where certain proteins shared by two separate allergens can cause a more severe reaction (for example, eating a banana during ragweed season). \\n\\nIt\\'s important to treat allergy symptoms, despite the temptation some have to \"tough it out\", since leaving them unchecked can cause more severe problems to develop (like asthma).',\n",

              " \"There are three main thin-screen display technologies: Liquid Crystal Displays, Plasma Displays, and Light Emitting Diode Displays.\\n\\nIn these are a couple of subcategories (I'll go through them one at a time): \\n\\nLCDs\\nis the LCD lit from the side or from the back, and using a compact fluorescent lamp (CCFL) or an LED array (LED LCD, usually sold as LED).\\n\\nPlasma\\nare the cells self colored, or do they use phosphors for color rendering?\\n\\nLED\\nis the display's pixels made from silicon transistors, or organic light emitting diodes? (OLED)\\n\\nIf you're lost, stick with me for a minute, let's explain what those mean.\\n\\nAll displays use between 2 and 4 subpixels for each picture element (the normal is three: Red, Green, and Blue), which combine to form the color of one square on the screen.\\n\\nLiquid crystal displays work on the principle of light called polarization.  Long story short, polarization can be used to create a light filter.  In front of each pixel is a small bit of liquid crystal that can either polarize the light or not.  When it polarizes the light, the light will be blocked by the next layer, which is a passive polarizer.  When it doesn't polarize the light, the light goes through.  And if it partially goes through, it filters out some of the brightness, running from black to white.  The liquid crystals respond to an electric charge to change the amount of polarization and create a shade of gray.  Color filters over each of the subpixels change the shade of gray into a shade of color.  Since the liquid crystal only filters the light, a light source is needed, either a CCFL or an LED panel behind or along the side of the display.  This is a major simplification, but that's the essence of what the liquid crystals do.\\n\\nPlasma\\nPlasma is a state of matter, where a gas has so much energy it begins to glow.  By trapping small amounts of gas in glass cells and electrifying them for a specific amount of time, I can make the glow and control how bright they glow.  When they glow, they either emit colored light (red, green, or blue) to make up sub pixels, or they emit invisible light that is absorbed by a coating, called a phosphor, on the surface of the cell that then glows a specific color.\\n\\nLED\\nLEDs are little electronics that emit light when a charge of sufficient voltage is passed over the diode, because of some very specific bits of physics.  The light the LEDs emit are very specific in color, and therefore are color tuned, with one LED for each sub pixel.  In large, stadium size displays, full-size LEDs can be used, while it's difficult to make minature LEDs for a flat panel display.  So, organic LEDs are used instead, which use chemical elements that can be painted onto surfaces to make the little LED.\\n\\nStrengths and Weaknesses:\\nLCDs: Typically are the least expensive type of display to make and therefore buy, but suffer from high black points (greyish blacks) because of imperfect filtering, and poor color reproduction, especially from off-angle viewing (because of the way the filter works).  LED backlights help with the color reproduction problems, and other technologies such as TFT IPS LCD technology help increase the off-angle viewing, but cost more.  LCDs can operate at high frequencies, like 120 or 240Hz, and work well for 3D displays for that reason.\\n\\nPlasma: These give true blacks and deep color reproduction, but have fixed frequencies of 50 or 60Hz, suck back a TON of electricity, have a scan pattern (which will make them flicker when filmed), and are very heavy.  They can be expensive to purchase.\\n\\nLED: OLED is a new technology and only found on some phones, primarily, and larger LED displays are usually expensive to build; in the future, OLEDs should give consumers the best of both worlds - the low power and high speed of LCDs, with the true blacks and wide color gamut of Plasma.\",\n",

A 'fifth' is a musical interval. A musical interval is the difference between two different pitches, i.e. how much higher or lower one is from the other. The strings are tuned a fifth apart to allow a wide range of possible notes. This arrangement is traditional; other tuning setups are of course possible.\\n\\nThe double bass is tuned with each string being a fourth apart from its neighbouring strings. This is because it is a physically larger instrument than the others. Different notes are produced on each string by pressing on it, reducing the length of the bit of the string that is vibrating (and therefore producing sound) and as a result making the sound higher.\\n\\nBy pressing on the string you can only shorten its vibrating length and thus only make the sound higher. If two strings are a fifth apart, then responsibility for all the notes in between falls to the lower string.\\n\\nOn a double bass, the places on the string that you must press to produce the different notes are far apart because of the size of the instrument. Therefore it is physically more convenient in terms of handspan, reach, speed, etc. to have the strings spaced more closely. \\n\\nThat is why the double bass is tuned in fourths when the violin, viola and cello are tuned in fifths.\\n\\n**TUNING ACROSS AN ORCHESTRA:**\\n\\nAn orchestra is not tuned in fifths - this is a mix up of terminology.\\n\\nAn orchestra is tuned to one reference pitch, which is typically a 'concert A', which is the name given to a pitch of 440 Hz (or sometimes 442/443 Hz in other countries).\\n\\nWhen each instrument plays their version of 'A', they must all sound the same / match up, otherwise the orchestra will sound out of tune. \\n\\nWhen you hear an orchestra tuning up, each player is making small adjustments to their instrument to make their 'A' sound like the standard 'A', which is traditionally given by an oboe as that instrument is loud and difficult to adjust.\\n\\nEach instrument with multiple places to produce sound (e.g. four strings on a violin) will use one string to get the standard 'A', and then will tune the other strings in relation to the 'A' string. As you can imagine it takes a lot of effort to tune a piano, with 88 different places to produce sound, as opposed to a trumpet, with one.\\n\\nI hope this post explains the difference between tuning an instrument with itself (internal), and tuning an instrument in relation to another instrument (external), along with the other issues of understanding implied in the wording of the question.\",\n",

              " 'If you\\'re interested in the why, then we need to do some physics.\\n\\nThe first big difference is in how we get the nuclear fuel and how we make it release energy. In traditional reactors there are two basic processes:\\n1) An \"enriched uranium\" cycle. Here we make fuel by \"enriching\" uranium (keeping fissile U-235 and discarding useless U-238), and we fission it with low energy (called \"thermal\") neutrons. \\n2) A \"Fast Breeder\" cycle. Here we make fuel by turning U-238 into Plutonium, and then we fission the plutonium. To make the U-238 absorb neutrons, we need to use high energy (\"fast\") neutrons. \\n\\nBoth approaches are unfortunate because they make it really easy to make nuclear bombs. An enriched uranium cycle can only use ~0.7% of the uranium, which isn\\'t good. Fast breeder cycles have to form plutonium, and so form a lot of long half life nuclear waste (search for TRU or actinides). This is bad because then we have to store it somewhere. Using fast neutrons also means that the structure ends up more radioactive, which makes it harder to decommission a site. Fast reactors also tend to be more unstable, in that there\\'s less stuff slowing the neutrons down and moderating the power output.\\n\\nIf we use thorium, then instead what we do is turn thorium into uranium-233 by getting it to absorb a neutron, and then we fission the uranium 233. What\\'s really nice about this process is that we can turn thorium into uranium using thermal neutrons. So we don\\'t have to use high energy neutrons. Because we fission uranium getting TRU waste requires that an atom *fails* to fission both as Uranium-233 and Plutonium-239; this is rare and so we don\\'t form much long life waste. Since the overall process requires 2 neutrons, and the fission of U-233 emits about 2.2 on average, this cycle also emits far less neutron radiation.\\n\\nThe really nice thing is that thorium naturally comes in only 1 flavour, which is the one we need. So we can use all of the thorium (which is itself around 3-4x more common than uranium), instead of only a tiny fraction, or needing to use a fast breeder. There\\'s no excuse to be handling plutonium or running enrichment facilities, so it\\'s harder to build a bomb. It\\'s not impossible, but due to the way the process works the Uranium-233 tends to get contaminated with uranium-232. In the reactor this doesn\\'t matter at all, but for bombs it\\'s a really big problem.\\n\\n\\nNow, all of this applies just as well to taking a \"traditional\" reactor and running it with thorium in it. Often when you hear about \"thorium reactors\", what people mean is a \"molten salt reactor\" using a thorium fuel. In this case there\\'s quite a bit more going on.\\n\\nIn a molten salt reactor, we replace the standard fuel rods with a fluid; normally a mixture of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride. Then we dissolve the fuels (thorium and uranium-233) in this fluid, normally as their tetrafluoride salts. The basic reason to do this is that fluoride salts are chemically unreactive (unlike metals), and have have very high boiling points. So there\\'s never any pressure inside the reactor, which means that we don\\'t need to have large pressure vessels. This means the reactors are much smaller and easier to shield or bury. It also means we can go to higher temperatures than are feasible with a steam cycle, which means better efficiency and new possible uses (like making hydrogen).\\n\\nWhere it\\'s really awesome is the safety side. When the fuel is a fluid, it can be removed from the reactor really quickly to a safe holding pan if anything wierd happens, or if the temperature in the reactor goes too high. An accident like Fukushima is thus much much harder to imagine, because if the temperature goes too high the fuel is moved from the reactor (where it\\'s encouraged to fission) to somewhere where it\\'s not. Furthermore, fluids expand when they warm up. So if the reactor warms up a little, the fuel expands and so there will be fewer fissile atoms in the reactor, which tends to reduce power output. As a result, these reactors are intrinsically stable when the power output changes, or if there are bubbles in the fuel (whereas, say, Chernobyl was not; if the cooling water started to boil it *increased* its power output... which is what caused the accident).\\n\\nIt also turns out that with a fluoride fuelled reactor, it\\'s not too hard to remove the fuel from the lithium-beryllium-fluoride fluid, and then separate the fission products and other short lived waste from the reactor. What this means is that instead of forming lots of long lived waste by \"cooking\" short lived waste in neutrons for a couple of years, we get it out. Some of it is medically very valuable, which is a bonus. For everyone else, the point is that we end up with \"waste\" that\\'s less radioactive than uranium ore after 200-300 years. Whilst that\\'s still quite a while, we understand how to build a structure that lasts that long, and how to mark it so that people will know what it is in 300 years. It also turns out that the quantities of waste involved are tiny. For the UK, if we got all of our energy (electrical, petrol, the lot) from thorium we\\'d need a couple of swimming-pool sized containers to store a few centuries worth of waste.\\n\\n\\nOverall, these thorium MSR\\'s or LFTR\\'s are really quite cool, and at least a couple of countries are interested in them.

But, you gotta break a few eggs to get an omellette.  \\n\\n\\nThen there is the fracking process.

As the protests grew larger, the military basically told Morsi to GTFO. He refused, and so the government rode in and removed him from power and threw him in jail. The military has been running the country since then.\\n\\nObviously a lot of people (especially Morsi supporters) are not happy with the military overthrowing an elected government. So there's been a lot more protesting, much of which the military government has responded to rather forcefully. \\n\\nLeaving aside the issue of whether or not Morsi's group (The Muslim Brotherhood) was really qualified to run the country, they've now been forcefully removed from positions in government that they were democratically elected to. This runs the risk of them deciding that working within the political system is not possible, and them instead turning towards violence to try to affect change. \\n\\nThe military says that they're going to hold new elections sometime in the near future and let a new government run the country, but nobody's really sure how that'll all play out.\",\n",

One is a pathway for current out of the transistor, usually ground. One is for controlling current. The last one is connected to a higher voltage, which is the source for current.\\n\\nIf you expose the control to a changing signal, you\\'ll get a changing amount of current flowing through the transistor. Technically, a certain type of amplification is already occurring.\\n\\nBut we usually start with voltage and want to end with voltage. One way to achieve this is for the transistor to draw its current through a resistor, which will produce a changing voltage thanks to the fundamental relationship between current and voltage passing through a resistor.\\n\\nThe problem is, this is a changing amount of current flowing in one direction. We usually want current flowing in both directions, alternately, for a signal like music playing through headphones.\\n\\nIn short, you use an assortment of transistors passing electricity in one direction only *within each one*, but in opposite directions to other ones in the circuit. It takes some complex and clever design, but you get it balanced right and you can create current flow in both directions, just like your original source.\\n\\nA helpful tool is that you can make \"backwards\" transistors that control flow with a controlling signal that is compared to the high voltage, not low.\\n\\nGoing into much more detail gets into \"take a class\" or \"read an intro to EE\" textbook levels of explanation, but that\\'s the basic idea.

(Both of these assume we are OK with holding the stock for five years, and that we\\'re discounting inflation and opportunity cost.) To him, it\\'s overvalued at $999; to me, it\\'s not. Everyone in the market has different agendas, time frames, and expectations, so there\\'s no \"wrong\" way to do it; there\\'s only erroneous judgements. \\n\\n2) The \"greater fool\" theory. Basically, an item (even a share) is \"worth\" it as long as someone is willing to buy it off of you at that price. As long as I can sell it to someone else at that price, I\\'m fine. This *does* mean that at some point someone is going to be left holding the bag...he\\'s the greater fool.

              " \"For the longest time, Jews have had a rough time. People all over Europe have had it out for them since the Middle Ages. They've been treated as second-class citizens and have experienced abuses from structures of power, including indiscriminate killing of those following the Jewish faith, most famously under the regime of Adolf Hitler, whose extermination of Jews is commonly referred to as the Holocaust. A big factor in this situation is the lack of a central homeland of the Jewish people. They tried, rather unsuccessfully, to integrate themselves into whatever culture they found themselves in until they were rooted out or hunted down. \\n\\nThis unstable situation gave rise to Zionism, the movement for Jews to establish their own state (country, nation, whatever word you prefer), preferably in Israel, the biblical promised land, also called Palestine.\\n\\nThe Zionist movement was kickstarted and championed by a man named Theodor Herzl. He petitioned different world powers for a grant of land for the Zionists to form a state and begin attracting Jews from around the world to make up the population. This was tricky, as the world powers were only willing to give up fairly crappy bits of land (Britain was ready to give the Zionists Uganda), and the Zionists at large were dead set on forming their state in Palestine.\\n\\nA breakthrough came with the Balfour Declaration, a position on behalf of the Crown pledging its support for the Zionists' place in Palestine. The declaration was later adopted by the League of Nations. \\n\\nJews began purchasing land in Palestine and working it to sustain themselves and form communities. This pissed off the local Arabs, sparking tensions that are still very present today. Over time, more and more Jews went to Israel. There were challenges along the way, such as immigration restrictions imposed by the British, unrest from the native populations, invasion attempts, the usual birth pangs of any young nation, et cetera.\",\n",

You start with 1 million bacteria, then an hour later you have 2 million, then an hour later it\\'s 4 million, then 8 million, then 16 million, and so on.  You write out a formula for how much bacteria there is after N hours, and you get 1,000,000 \\\\* 2^N (note that 2^0 is 1, so this formula is just fine).\\n\\nWhen you look at this population you might ask \"how fast is the population growing?\"  Well, over the first hour it grew by 1 million bacteria so you might say that it\\'s growing at 1 million bacteria per hour, but if you counted every 30 minutes you\\'d find that there\\'s only about 1.4 million after 30 minutes but after a full hour there\\'s 2 million, so maybe you say that the population is growing at about (400,000 bacteria) / (30 minutes) = 800,000 bacteria per hour for the first half hour, then 1,200,000 bacteria per hour for the second half hour.\\n\\nYou could keep on looking at the growth over a shorter and shorter period of time and you\\'d get a more and more accurate measurement of the bacterial growth per hour.\\n\\nWhat you\\'d notice is that the number of bacteria added to the population per hour is always a constant multiple of the population:  when the population is 1 million the growth rate is 693,147/hr.  When the population is 10 million it\\'s 6,931,472/hr, and so on.  There\\'s always that constant ratio of .693147.... between the growth rate and the number of bacteria there are.\\n\\nNext we look at another population of bacteria that split a little faster.  They *triple* their population each hour, so you start with 1 million bacteria, then an hour later you have 3 million, then 9 million, and so on.  You come up with a formula for this population and it\\'s 1,000,000 \\\\* 3^(N).\\n\\nAgain you look at how fast the population is growing and again you find that there\\'s this constant ratio between the number of bacteria you add per hour (as measured over a very very short period of time) and the number of bacteria there are.  This time, though, the ratio is different:  it\\'s 1.0986... \\n\\nAt this point you ask \"How fast does the bacteria have to grow to make that ratio be 1?\"  We\\'ve seen that doubling in an hour is too low, while tripling in an hour is a bit too high.

In calculus we call this idea of \"rate of change, as measured over an incredibly short period of time\" a derivative, and the derivative of e^x is e^(x).  The constant e is the only number for which that can be true; for any other number you wind up with those constants.\\n\\nYou asked about logarithms, but logarithms are just backwards exponentiation.  They confuse people because they\\'re written as a word, but they should be no more confusing than learning that subtraction undoes addition or that division undoes multiplication.

With logarithms it\\'s the same but written more confusingly:  if 3^4 = 81 then log*_3_*(81) = 4.\\n\\nWhen you deal with exponential growth you often deal a lot with e as the base, since it has that property I mentioned earlier of having a rate of change equal to itself.  You also frequently have to deal with undoing the exponentiation if you want to find the exponent and just know the base and the answer, hence bringing in logarithms.  These two things coincide often enough that it\\'s efficient to just have shorthand for \"do the reverse of e^(a) = b\" so we write ln(b) = a.',\n",

              " \"Don't assume Shkreli has done anything with KaloBios. Shkreli bought 70% of the outstanding shares of KBIO and is not allowing his shares to be lent out to cover short selling. It's that simple. We don't know what's going to happen with KBIO because we've only had this issue arise for 15 days, which is not enough time to really see what the results of Shkreli's acquisition will be. \\n\\nThe detailed answer, however, is as follows. \\n\\nAt the beginning of November, KBIO was ready to close up shop and go under. Their funding dried up, they had no money and were ready to basically declare bankruptcy. Investors saw this as an opportunity to short the stock for a small profit. Basically, they bet the stock was going to drop from, say $5 a share, to $0 a share. Investors borrowed shares from people who owned them, and then sold the borrowed shares in an attempt to make money. In order to take a profit (or loss), these traders will then buy the shares back to close the trade. \\n\\nShkreli sees this company is in dire straits and thought there was value in the company, so once the company dropped to roughly $1/Share, over the course of two days Shkreli bought ~70% of the company's outstanding shares. That is roughly 2.87 Million Shares bought against the KBIO's roughly 4.1 Million Shares outstanding. \\n\\nThe sudden surge in buying led to the stock price increasing dramatically, to the point where the company is worth now ~35+/Share. These short sellers are either scrambling to cover their shorts (basically, they took a huge loss and want out), or are opening new shorts (basically betting that the stock will drop in price at look to make even more money at this top). \\n\\nThe thing is Shkreli didn't do anything wrong. He saw an opportunity to make some money and acquire a drug company. If the story is true, he bought everything within 2 days, well within the initial Schedule 13D notice period for filing, so it's not like he broke a law concerning his ownership stake. Shkreli informed KBIO that he owned 70% of the company and began to discuss how to proceed in keeping the company up and running. \\n\\nThis news comes out and the stock increase in value. A few days later, as short interest increases in the company, Shkreli decides to no longer lend the shares. Remember how I said shares needed to be borrowed from someone. That someone is a lender who has a large quantity of shares that they don't plan to necessarily immediately move. I don't know if Shkreli intentionally had his shares up for lending, if it was done unintentionally by his prime broker because the shares were marked as marginable, or through any other plausible method, but Shkreli stopped allowing his shared to be lended out. This reduced the available shares outstanding from 4.1 Million Shares that could be borrowed against to 1.13 Million Shares that could be borrowed against. Now, people are trying to figure out what's going on with the value of the company since such a small amount of shares can be viably traded. All the while, there is no indication of what is going on inside KBIO yet, but that is due to the fact that at 15 days old, there is still a great deal of potential work that is being done to get a deal worked out for short term funding, etc.\",\n",

              " \"There are many reasons, but broadly speaking it has to do with motive. Who is motivated to see stock prices to go up and down? Simply speaking there are 3 main parties to this, shareholders, management and the government. \\n\\nShareholders want to see the price of a stock go up. The higher it goes the more they can sell it for when they retire, or cash out to buy a home a car or something. Shareholders generally have no real reason to see the price go down. \\n\\nCompany management like wise have little motivation in seeing the price of their stock go down. The higher it is, the more successful their company looks, the better rewards they'll receive for creating value for the company/ shareholders. Management is generally not interested in seeing the stock price fall.\\n\\nShareholders and management in China are similar in their motivation to shareholders and management in the US. No one wants to see their portfolio/ stock price fall. The difference is the ability to profit from incorrect pricing. It is easier outside of China to recognize and profit from errors in stock pricing. This will tend to push stock prices down to generally accepted true value.\\n\\nBut where does the government fit in? The value of companies to governments is usually a source of pride, or a badge of success, and while governments would like to create environments where companies can succeed, and they usually don't get too involved. However, in China it is more than that. The government is actively involved in companies. The Chinese government owns many companies and has a stake in others. Party members can be appointed on the board or in leadership positions within companies. The government is the management and the shareholders. So are they motivated to see the price of stocks fall? \\n\\nBetting against state owned companies in such an environment could easily be seen as antagonistic towards the government and state. This could easily scare off the people who would have the knowledge and ability to do so. If you know a state owned company is over-priced but think you'll suffer some type of penalty or censure if you make a move against it, is it really worth the trouble? Why not park your money somewhere you feel is safer and let it remain someone else's problem? \\n\\nAs a result of this environment many stocks prices have climbed to prices they don't belong and people aren't sure where they should have been. So everyone is trying to sell off their stock and save what is left of their investment. There are price bubbles all over the world in many different forms varying from beanie babies to housing securities. The market and government are yet to figure out an accurate way to predict and prepare for them. That being said, there are ways to mitigate and warn. Primarily this is through independent analysis of stocks and companies. Many investment firms have analysts that go through a company's statements and records in order to figure out the truthfulness of those records and ascertain the company's value. Smaller companies may pay organizations like Bloomberg or Zachs to conduct an analysis of their own company to provide transparency to their stock holders (not entirely independent, agreed). \\n\\nThe point is, the ability to independently analyse companies without repercussions, and to act on that analysis helps to avoid and soften the blow. A Chinese stock market isn't simply a matter of national pride, its a matter of control. The Chinese government maintains tight control of their currency and routinely interferes in the stock market, which along with penalties for non-positive feedback makes analysis difficult and unreliable.\\n\\nEDIT TLDR: Prices are too high, no one knows what the price should be so everyone is selling their stock.\",\n",

It\\'s just that, in the UK, these laws are found scattered about the place, and there are also various protocols, traditions and regulations that are all part of the constitution.\\n\\nAn important reason for that is that there has been no radical change of the system of government recently, and it\\'s very old.

Since then, new treaties, laws and traditions have come into being and now have the force of constitutional law.

In some countries, a change to the constitution will require something like a 2/3 majority and/or a referendum to pass, for example. In Britain, a simple Act of Parliament can change the constitution: for example, in 2010, a law was passed fixing the parliamentary term at five years -- previously, a government could call an election at any time within five years. (The latest election was called early, but the law says that\\'s possible if it gets 2/3 majority support, which it did.)\\n\\nThat is quite scary, but the most important parts of constitutional law are beset by all sorts of safeguards which can\\'t be removed quite so easily, and Parliament must observe the rule of law. Recently, for example, the Supreme Court prevented the government from using what\\'s called the \"Royal Prerogative\" to authorize Britain\\'s withdrawal from the EU without Parliamentary approval -- the referendum had made no mention of using the Royal Prerogative, and so a bill had to be introduced, debated and voted on.\\n\\nSome things are technically possible, but very much constitute a nuclear option. In the TV drama *King Charles III*, the king refuses to sign a bill into law, enters the House of Commons and dissolves Parliament. While he could, in theory, do all those things, in reality any one of them would provoke a constitutional crisis and probably end the monarchy (the last time a king walked into the Commons, it started a civil war).\\n\\nAnd it also means that it\\'s often not clear what the constitution says, or even if it says anything at all. At the moment, Britain has a minority government -- there are more MPs on the opposition benches than on the government benches. We\\'ve just had the Queen\\'s Speech, in which the Queen reads out a list of things the government has on its to-do list. This is now being debated, and there will be a vote on it. If the government loses this vote... nobody knows what\\'s supposed to happen. It would show that the current government does not have the support of the House of Commons, but what then? Do we have to have yet another election? Or does the Conservative Party hand over to the Labour Party to try to form a working coalition with some of the other parties? The second option would be a constitutional nightmare, because it would be in effect a regime change without an election, and that\\'s never happened before in the UK. If we take the first option, there\\'s a real risk that the result will be much the same as what we have now.\\n\\nSo yes, there is a constitution. It\\'s just that Britain makes it up as it goes along.',\n",

The name gerrymandering comes from when the governor of Massachusetts (Elbridge Gerry) and his party drew some odd looking districts in order to make sure that his party had a majority in most of them.  One of those districts looked like a bit like a skalamander, so it was mocked as a \"gerrymander\" district.  \\n\\nThe gerrymander districts work like this: \\n\\nLet\\'s say that there are 10 seats available to district in a state with 100 people.  If 60 of those people are part of the Cake Party and 40 are part of the Ice Cream Party, it would seem most fair if 6 out of 10 of the districts had Cake advantages, and 4 out of those districts had Ice Cream advantages (at least in theory).  \\n\\nThe Cake party has control of the state house and the governor\\'s office, so they are in charge of drawing the lines.  Instead of making the districts represent the people, they draw all sorts of crazy lines to group people together so that every district has 6 Cakers and 4 Ice Creamers.  Instead of the districts representing the true will of the people, the crazy lines make it so that all 10 districts have Cake favor abilities... even if Ice Creamers and Cakers tend not to live in the same area. To get to that point, Cakers had to cut neighborhoods apart to split Ice Cream voters.  \\n\\nObviously, that kind of system isn\\'t exactly fair.  While there are some conflicting and incomplete SCOTUS rulings about gerrymandering, it\\'s generally accepted that courts have the right and authority to reject gerrymandering based on certain criteria.  \\n\\nIn the case of North Carolina, a panel of federal judges determined that North Carolina had drawn its lines based on \"invidious partisan intent\".

The patent gives you a 'negative right' - you have no obligation to make or sell your product, but you can force other people to not sell it (or to charge a fee for selling it).\\n\\nSay you invent the nail clipper.

As far as I'm aware the line between a method and an idea can be very blurry.\\n\\nThere are different levels of patents. The first patent would stop anyone from manufacturing and selling nail clippers. It is the stronger of the two patents, because you have complete control over the invention. The second patent does not stop people from selling nail clippers, only from selling clippers for the purpose of clipping nails. A competitor could sell their own version of the nail clippers, but only if they said on the packet 'not for fingernails!

In this case the complete garment would have two pants, or better, a pair. Pantaloon as a garment could be used in the singular, but most often the plural was preferred. \\n\\nIn the U.S. in particular, the single word \"pant\" came be used in the retail clothing industry (late 19th c. onward) to represent what every one else would call either \"pants\" or \"a pair of pants,\" e.g., \" A practical and well made pant for general sportswear\" (L.L.

But \"pants\" as we know them really got their start as a colloquialism in the U.S. in the 19th century. There is still a widespread feeling that \"pants\" are not quite as dignified as \"trousers.\" \\n\\nI mentioned pantaloon. The word has an interesting history, which I\\'ll only touch on. It was orginally the name of a character in the Italian commedia dell\\'arte. He represented a Venetian type and spoke in Venetian dialect (as did the Zanni character), and wore close-fitting trousers down to the foot. (Most commedia characters were known not only by their name, their calling, their dialect, and their manner, but also by their costume.) \\n\\nThe French picked up on the name Pantalon (their version of Pantaleone), and passed it to the English as Pantaloon, both of which were used both for pants and for the character. Pantaloon is an old fool, whether in Italian, French or English. \\n\\nThis does not answer the question about using the plural for a singular garment. This is also the case with shorts (that is, short pants). After the term \"pants\" came to be accepted for female attire, we had also pantaloons and panties, the latter being used both in the singular and in the plural, mostly in the plural. In a panty-raid, one steals panties. If a girl on spring break accidentally drops her bikini bottom you may say, \"She dropped her panties.\" I don\\'t know if anyone would ever say, \"She lost her panty,\" but I don\\'t think so.

              " 'To take down the DNS you\\'d probably want to focus on disrupting the DNS root servers. These servers basically keep track of Top Level Domain name servers which keep track of .com/.org/.biz/.mil/.gov/.edu/ etc TLDs. There have been many such attacks with varying degrees of success but so far no one has taken the entire DNS down for any meaningful amount of time. A fellow by the name of Dan Kaminsky uncovered a (if exploited) fatal security exploit in 2008 but luckily for everyone he chose to notify the authorities instead of use the exploit for malicious purposes. For his efforts he was given one of the 14 \"keys\" to the DNS system. In the event of a failure 7 of the 14 keyholders must meet at a secret pre-determined place in order to reboot the DNS.\\n\\nThe technique Dan Kaminsky discovered exploited a flaw in the way DNS servers decide which servers they can trust and which ones they can\\'t. Basically he found he could trick a DNS server into believing that he was also a \"trustable\" DNS server and that domain name lookup tables he provided were therefore also legit. Of course if you can feed incorrect information to DNS server which it will blindly accept you can destroy its lookup tables in what is known as cache poisoning. If those tables become corrupted the server becomes effectively useless at providing correct information and its tables will need to be rebuilt.\\n\\nOther methods such as DDoS are much more crude and work by simply overwhelming the system with bogus requests so that it doesn\\'t have time to respond to legitimate requests, effectively grinding everything to a halt. These kinds of attacks are usually limited to smaller parts of the DNS because they simply don;t have the \"firepower\\' to be able to knock out the whole thing. Additionally, the DNS is designed in such a way that the attack would have to completely saturate the system for more that 24 hours before it could actually start to mess things up. Usually in that amount of time you can either deploy some counter measures or find other ways to filter out the malicious traffic.\\n\\nRecently efforts have been made to make the DNS much more distributed and therefore much harder to completely take offline. There have been many security enhancements but there will almost definitely always been some means of exploiting other existing vulnerabilities if you have the time and resources to do so.

              " 'When the US federal government needs to pay more for things than it collects in taxes, it sells \"Treasury Bonds\" which pay a set (but usually small) amount of interest. Treasury Bonds are low return but from a country like the US they are as close as the world gets to no risk. The US has never missed a payment since 1775, and there is no reason to think it will stop any time soon. So by buying these bonds you trade high return for high security. \\n\\nThe rate of return (how much money is payed to bond holders) is set by a combination of the Federal Reserve\\'s interest rate as well as the demand for bonds. The lower the interest rate the less the debt \"costs.\" Right now a 5 year bond has a .8% interest, then if you buy $5,000 worth of bonds you will receive .8% interest at the end of five years on your $5,000. The payments are on a fixed schedule so people can\\'t just suddenly \"demand their money early.\"\\n\\nMost bonds are bought by Americans or American institutions like banks. In 2008 as the height of the collapse (for example) there wasn\\'t even enough bonds to go around because security was valued so highly at the time, so they could be offered at near zero (.001%) return and banks would still buy them because it decreased the risk they had. Of the current $15 (not 16) trillion, about $11 trillion are owned by Americans or American institutions. So while we owe China money, they aren\\'t the ones who own most of the debt.\\n\\nThe debt is in a never ending state of being re-payed and then re-borrowed. Alexander Hamilton wanted there to be a US debt because it both establishes a base interest rate, allows credit to flow between banks easily and a few other technical things. Andrew Jackson was the one and only president to pay off the debt in full, and when he did and there were no more bonds the credit and banking system of the country froze up. It caused a financial \"panic\" and a minor recession. Jackson then started borrowing again and as a result credit began to flow more easily. \\n\\nBut it is possible to pay the debt back, though not advisable to pay it all back until there is no debt at all. Following World War II we had (adjusted for inflation) roughly double the debt we have today. Then in the rest of the 40s and into the 50s the government kept taxes high to pay back all those people who bought bonds. The debt kept going down until the 1970s when the economy slowed down, but by then we had reduced the debt to pre-Great Depression levels. \\n\\nThe reason why the debt is so big is quite simple: low taxes. Reagan\\'s tax cuts lead to him tripping the debt in eight years. Clinton raised taxes and eventually got a surplus. Then the second Bush cut taxes to below Reagan\\'s level and Obama has cut them further than that. Bad economies always lead to more debt, but the reason why its *so* bad is the low taxes. We have the single lowest tax rate in the first world, and that\\'s not from some liberal think tank, that\\'s the CIA\\'s own numbers. If we ever want to pay back the debt we need to raise taxes, and not just on the rich, everyone needs to pay more taxes. \\n\\nTL;DR: The money is owed to many people and institutions, but most of them are American. People do claim the money they are owed because payments are made at a regular schedule like paying off any other kind of debt. The debt increased from $1 trillion in 1980 to $15 trillion now mostly due to low taxes, but the explosion since 2008 has been due more so to a bad economy than anything else. It is possible to pay back all the debt, but *some* national debt is good for the economy because it creates bonds which are the safest form of investment. World War II lead to double the debt we have now, and we paid most of that off easily with a good post-war economy and high taxes.',\n",

I\\'ll try to answer to the best of my ability while keeping it simple. \\n\\nThe first reason relates to how you actually taste things. The way we perceive taste is actually a combination of our taste buds and our nose working. Taste buds send a signal to the brain when food touches them. But your nose is also very important. You have probably experienced the decrease in taste perception when you have a cold or stuffy nose. There is a passageway in the back of your throat called the retronasal route that leads into your nose. So when the food hits this spot, you essentially \"smell\" it from inside your mouth, and this adds another layer to flavor perception.\\n\\nDifferent food flavors volatilize, or become airborne (smellable) at different temperature. You will notice this when you cook. As you pull the ingredients out of the fridge they might have some odor to them, but once they are all in a pot together cooking the smell is amplified and starts to fill the whole house. In the same way, you will essentially \"smell\" hotter food through the retronasal route in your throat more than colder food, because the flavors are more airbourne. \\n\\nThere is also an interesting link between temperature and taste. In studies, people tend to perceive spicy foods as less spicy when they are cold. If you keep your hot sauce in the fridge, you will notice this. This is probably due to the reasons I explained above.',\n",

However, it had one major issue that prevented it from widespread use in the mid-'90s: it wasn't secure.

A person needs two little 'r's, one from the father and one from the mother, to have blue eyes. Here's where it gets interesting. Father and Mother do not need to have blue eyes to necessarily have a blue eyed kid. If Mom has a Brown eyed allele and blue eyed allele, she will have brown eyes, but still carry a blue eyed gene, or what we would write as 'Rr'. If the father has the same 'Rr' pattern, then there is 1/4 chance of one of their kids getting 'rr' and having blue eyes. Also, they will have a 1/2 chance of getting a kid with 'Rr', meaning the gene is still present, even if it isn't being expressed. \\n\\n\\nA one more point before I wrap up with an answer. Since blue eyes do not necessarily put a person at risk of early death in the wild, they are not selected against in population. The lack of disadvantage means that the likelihood of someone with blue eyes living as long as someone with brown eyes is pretty good, and increases the chances of a blue eyed person mating with another blue eyed person, or a brown eyed person with an 'r' allele. You could even argue that blue eyes are selected for in modern populations, as some consider those with blue eyes more attractive and therefore increase that person's chances of mating (although the applicability of that could definitely be questioned).\\n\\nIn short\\n\\n\\nBecause a gene can be carried without being expressed in a person, it can survive a surprising amount of time without ever showing up as a blue eyed person. All it takes to express that gene is one other person with that recessive allele to mate with them, and a blue eyed person can be born. And because blue eyes are not usually selected against in nature, when someone does appear with blue eyes they are just as likely to mate as any other member of the population, increasing the chances of persistence in population.\\n\\nEdit: I should have probably made this a bit more clear, eye color is not 100% controlled by one gene, it is controlled by quite a few genes that give each eye a unique hue and pattern. Eye color as whole however does work pretty well in models for autosomal traits.\",\n",

When pressure is put on the skin, the faster pain signals can be physically blocked from reaching the brain while the slower ones pass through.\\n\\nSo how is this all related to shaking? By quickly shaking your fingers around, you are subjecting your fingers to g-forces as they are in a constant state of acceleration and deceleration, which could potentially provide enough pressure to dull some of that initial intense pain.\" -/u/Zaburino from the last time it was posted.

              " 'First, some background: Most states have a law that says that the state isn\\'t allowed to infringe on people\\'s religions, even with a \"neutral\" law, unless there\\'s no other way to do something important.  \\n\\nSo, for example, a law against murder can be used against a person whose religion says they should be allowed to murder, because protecting people\\'s lives is important, and because how else do you stop murders, except by stopping them?  \\n\\nBut, say they pass a law that says all hamburgers have to have cheese on them, because dairy farmers need help selling cheese.  A guy who runs a kosher restaurant (Kosher laws, among other things, say no milk with cheese) can sue to prevent the government from enforcing that law against his business. And he\\'d probably win, both because helping dairy farmers isn\\'t that important AND because there\\'s ways for the government to help dairy farmers that don\\'t infringe on religious belief (like just subsidizing them directly, or making business owners buy cheese, but not forcing them to put it on hamburgers. \\n\\nThe TLDR of this is that, if the state tries to make you do something that goes against your religious beliefs, you can sue on the basis of your religious beliefs. \\n\\nSo, since that\\'s already the law, what has Mississippi done?  From what i\\'ve been told, they\\'ve changed that law so that now, the state doesn\\'t have to be a party in the lawsuit, and it can be brought on behalf of a person or a business.  The classic example here is discrimination lawsuits.  If I sue you and the company because you fired me because I am black, the state isn\\'t part of the suit.  Sure, the discrimination law was passed by the state, but the suit is Me v. You, The Company.  \\n\\nTraditionally, those cases were beyond the reach of the laws I described above.  This is because, while it\\'s one thing for the state to make you break your religious beliefs, it\\'s another thing for us to let one individual impose their religious beliefs on another person, let alone a corporate \"person,\" and, in the few instances where it might be a conflict, we as a society usually don\\'t care. (That your religion tells you to discriminate against black people is not usually seen as a great reason to let you not hire black people.  Likewise, if you drive drunk because your religion tells you to be drunk, we don\\'t want you to be able to use that as a way to prevent the person you hit from suing you for damages.)\\n\\nAnd that\\'s where bullying comes in.  The idea is that now, if you are dealing with someone who has some power over you, like an employer, their religion becomes a defense for them against all manner of legal action.  Someone harasses you for being gay? The harasser can now argue that the law should have an exception for harassing people who are sinners? Some county in Mississippi finally passes an anti-discrimination act that protects you from being fired for being gay? doesn\\'t matter if the jury buys that discriminating against gays is a sufficiently important religious mandate for the owner or for the business. \\n\\nUltimately, the \"bullying\" language is political framing, but it is a real change in the law that will make it harder to pass effective anti-discrimination law, and harder for people to sue to counter the effects of certain kinds of discrimination.  At the same time, it will increase the protections for people of religious conscience and strong belief.',\n",

Now image that that sphere isn\\'t exactly perfect.  Image just one of those balls is slightly offset.  What is going to happen?  If we image that the ball is slightly \"to the left\" of where it should be, now instead of everything pulled directly to the center, everything is pulled just slightly in that direction.  This little hitch is going to cause the shape not to be completely uniform.  It\\'s still going to pull everything towards the center, but it will also cause everything to spin just a bit in the direction of that non-uniformity.\\n\\nSo in the real world, when big giant clouds of hydrogen start to get pulled together by gravity, because the hydrogen isn\\'t uniformly distributed, it starts to spin as it collapses.  Things that spin tend to bulge out on an axis relative to the direction of that spin.  When the inner portion of that cloud reaches a certain density, a star is formed, and that outer bulge gets left behind to solidify into planets.

By allowing zero mistakes? No, because that cannot be done. Unless you have an airliner designed and flown by God with Jesus Christ working as an air traffic controller, you will inherently have errors and mistakes. The system is set up so that no one error/ mistake/ flaw will result in disaster. Redundancy is key to this philosophy. The airplanes have multiple systems so they can tolerate a complete system failure and still fly, e.g. an engine can stop working and the airplane is just fine on the other engine. That's also why there are two highly-trained pilots. they take turns flying the plane and the pilot not flying acts as a monitor, making sure the guy flying isn't fucking up. In addition, any crashes that occur are extensively and thoroughly investigated. Sadly, lots of the Federal Aviation Regulations are written in blood and exist because somebody before fucked up and killed a bunch of people. \\nAlso, it seems to be a common theme that people think the plane flies itself. This is just not true. You can set the plane up to fly profiles, but the automation of the airplane must be managed by the pilots. \\n\\nTL;DR Accidents happen when a series of errors accumulate resulting in disaster.

              " \"The internet is a network of networks. \\n\\nYou pay an Internet Service Provider (ISP for short) for a cable running to your house. This cable connects to a central point where more cables connect (usually quite close to you), which connects it to a bigger cable. This bigger cable in turn goes to your ISP. There are more mini networks like this going to that same ISP.\\n\\nThis means that you are now connected to every other computer within the network of your ISP. There is always a path you can take to connect to another computer within this network.\\n\\nIn order to connect with other computers in networks maintained by other ISPs, your ISP, and another ISP have agreed to connect their networks to each other. This means that you can now also connect to computers on the network of that other ISP.\\n\\nIf there is an ISP that has no direct connection to your ISP, but does have a connection to another ISP which your ISP does have a connection with, then you are transitively also connected to that not-directly connected ISP.\\n\\nThe connections within and between these networks can be achieved by any way you can transmit data. Each medium has its own weaknesses and strengths. Usually these connections are a form of cable (since that is the most reliable medium), but they can also be transmitted over radio frequencies, or even via satellites.\\n\\nFor connections between continents, there are massive underseas cables. This means that the European network is connected to the American network (for example).\\n\\nNot every computer neccesarily speaks the same language though. So in order for every computer to connect to the internet, some standards had to be defined. There are standards that dictate how computers should request connections to other computers, standards that dictate how data should be transfered, etc.\\n\\nThe internet as you know it today is a product of decades of expansion and improvements. Noone really owns the internet, but ISPs and governments technically own parts of the infrastructure that makes up the internet. However, since the internet is so massively complex and interconnected, if any of these parts fail, or get shut down for any reason, it wouldnt affect the internet at large.\\n\\nI mentioned before how the internet always end in a regular computer. That is not neccesarily true. You can replace this computer with any internet capable device, for any number of reasons. \\n\\nAn example you can replace a computer on this network with is a router. The purpose of a router is to create a small sub-network (usually within the house) in order to be able to connect multiple computers at the same time, to the cable provided by the ISP.\\n\\nA computer on the internet can also function as a server.

              " 'You are surrounded by noise, all the time. Unlike your eyes, which have built-in-light-blockers, your ears remain open and receiving stimuli 24/7 to the little hairs inside of your ear that translate vibration into signals for sounds.\\n\\nRemember when your Dad was telling you a really interesting story that you were completely focused and fixated on? Every word from his mouth triggered a sound wave to go into your ear, stimulate hairs, which then create signals that travel to your cortex. Think of the cortex as a room full of scientists crunching away on numbers and doing all manner of things that make you function. \\n\\nSo as your Dad is talking to you, your Cortex is firing away, releasing hormones, storing information, etc. etc. Imagine all these scientists making notes, writing down their own theories, connections between ideas, modifications to existing memories. Stacks upon stacks of paper.\\n\\nBy the end of the night, you\\'re tired -- and so is your cortex. But the world wont leave your cortex alone. As you slip on your pajamas, you stimulate more nerve cells which send signals to your cortex. When you brush your teeth, your cortex is putting in extra hours to handle all of those sensations. And as you lay down in your bed, even as still as you possibly can be, your cortex can\\'t escape the chirp of a cricket, or creep of a board, or scratch of a tree against your window.\\n\\nBut your brain needs rest. The cortex put in a long day\\'s worth of work, and needs to freshen up for another day of thinking. Your brain also needs to sift through all of the notes that were made during the day and file them into your memory library, move stuff around, clean up. So how do we stop the sensory signals? **Thalamus to the rescue.**\\n\\nThe Thalamus is the part of the brain that sensory signals must pass through in order to get to the cortex. Think of it as a guard with a velvet rope standing outside the Cortex room full of your thinkin\\' scientists. It has the power to deny sensory input from hitting the cortex and waking everybody up. It does this by releasing \"spindle\" brainwaves periodically through the night which block incoming sensory signals. The more frequent the spindles, the more able it is to keep anything from bugging the cortex.\\n\\nBut now we have a new problem -- the fact that our ears are constantly listening is a very good thing. It allows us to respond to threats or dangers when we are most vulnerable. So the Thalamus doesn\\'t make people go deaf to the world while they sleep. Rather, it does its best to eliminate noise and unimportant background sounds. So if you were used to sleeping in the country, out in the middle of nowhere, you would probable struggle to sleep in a busy city due to all the new sounds that would be hitting your ears. Your thalamus wouldn\\'t know what to do. It would be confronted with a new sound it had no clue what to do with and think, \"Well, dang... i better let the boss check this out,\" then pass it to your cortex and wake everybody up. It\\'s not just that the sounds would be louder in the city vs. the country. If you took someone living in the city and placed them out in the middle of nowhere, the \"sound\" of silence may be enough to keep your Thalamus on edge. Likewise, the chirping of crickets could become maddening.\\n\\nIn other words, we acclimate and adapt to \"background\" noise and our brain auto-filters it out so that it can rest. It\\'s why people who travel a lot often bring white noise machines, as it provides a constant form of noise that muffles out foreign noises, and it stays consistent from place to place making it super easy for your Thalamus to flag it as useless and not wake you up.\\n\\n**With that said**... more specifically to the heart of your question: Why do you wake up when your family/SO make gentle sounds, but can sleep through other common noises?\\n\\nWell, just as it is important for your Thalamus to be alerted to new/different sounds for the sake of threats and dangers that may occur while sleeping, there are certain sounds that are so inherently important to us that they act as a sort of \"fire alarm.\" In other words, you care a lot about your family and SO. They are likely on your mind a lot, and your Cortex has spent a lot of resources making sure they are safe, etc. etc. As a result, the Thalamus will pass those sounds through as well to wake the brain up. A baby crying, for example, is one of the most disturbing and hard-to-acclimate sounds for your brain... which is a good thing if you\\'re a deep sleeper and you need to help your baby. Similarly, certain peoples\\' voices, or hearing a specific word (like your name), or creek can all get waved through due to their deep-rooted affect on your brain.\\n\\n*tl;dr:* You love your family more than you love birds, TVs, and other environmental noises. You know it. Your cortex knows it. And Thalamus totes knows it.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nBonus science: Even when you are completely awake, your brain is still muting out stimuli. It\\'s why you don\\'t really notice or think about the fact that you have clothing touching your skin for most of the day, yet you\\'d immediately feel someone gently moving their finger across your shirt. Likewise, there\\'s a ton of sounds going on that are only manageable because your brain has been dealing with it since before you were born. In fact, one of the issues with people who are born with hearing impairments and then later get something like a cochlear implant to allow them to hear, is that their brains aren\\'t efficiently wired to deal with all the new stimuli and it struggles to separate \"noise\" from \"important sounds.\" Also, this is one of the hardest issues to overcome when dealing with voice inputs for computers. People can easily listen to multiple conversations happening in the same room, but without the right filtering (which a computer lacks) it is just a room full of noise bouncing off noise.\\n\\n**Double edit bonus:** I really don\\'t want to study right now, so I thought I\\'d add another interesting thing about all of this re: marketing. \"Ad blindness\" is a problem that marketers are constantly trying to find a way around. It\\'s why Facebook got into so much trouble when they used pictures of your friends in targeted ads. Everyone thought it was creepy -- and it was -- but it was also genius. You see many people every day. In your life, you\\'ve seen thousands of faces of thousands of people. But it too becomes noise. However, **familiar** faces get priority access to your brain\\'s attention/focus. So your brain may ignore ads on a website to the point that you genuinely never know they exist because your eyes refuse to look -- but add a picture of a friend, and BOOM -- an ad has your attention. Similarly, if you listen to morning radio shows, pay attention to the commercials. Often times, they will select a voice that is very similar to the host of whatever morning talk show is on (or just pay the talk show host to read an ad). Why? Because your brain zones out when it doesn\\'t care, and it does it **really** well... but if you can connect something that a person is familiar with, then it acts as a trojan horse. It\\'s the same reason celebrities are hired to be spokespeople. Millions of people become familiar with an individual\\'s face, voice, brand, etc... and simply placing that person next to a product can be enough to sneak the ad past your brain\\'s senses. \\n\\nAlright, I\\'m done for now.

It has now been acknowledged by the Obama administration.\\n\\nIn the words of national security reporter Marc Ambinder, \"PRISM [is] a kick-ass GUI that allows an analyst to look at, collate, monitor, and cross-check different data types provided to the NSA from Internet companies located inside the United States.\"\\n\\n**It only targets foreigners?**\\n\\nPRISM \"cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen (PDF), or any other U.S. person, or to intentionally target any person known to be in the United States, according to a statement released by Director Clapper on June 8.\\n\\n**So how does this affect an American\\'s data?**\\n\\nThe key word is intentional. The NSA can\\'t intentionally target an Americans data. But analysts need only be at least 51 percent confident of a target\\'s \"foreignness.\"\\n\\n**What is PRISM not?**\\n\\nIt is apparently not the name for an overarching secret surveillance program in affiliation with certain large tech companies, as was originally reported by The Washington Post. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has released a statement saying, \"PRISM is not an undisclosed collection or data mining program.\" Instead, the name PRISM appears to refer to the actual computer program used to collect and analyze data legally requested by the NSA and divulged by Internet companies. This matches reports from CNET and The New York Times.\\n\\nHowever, as the New York Times reported late Friday evening, it has come to light that the nine large tech companies first reported to be working with the NSA to divulge information have, in fact, made it easier for the government to access data from their servers.\\n\\n**Which companies are involved?**\\n\\nMicrosoft, Yahoo, AOL, Facebook, Google, Apple, PalTalk, YouTube, and Skype. Dropbox is allegedly \"coming soon.\" However, 98 percent of PRISM production is based on just Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft.\\nAll nine of them have explicitly denied that the government has \"direct access\" to their servers. Reliable sources have confirmed to CNET that PRISM works on a request-by-request basis, rather than unfettered access, as was originally reported by the Washington Post. Here is a direct quote from our in-depth article on this issue:\\n\\n > Those reports are incorrect and appear to be based on a misreading of a leaked Powerpoint document, according to a former government official who is intimately familiar with this process of data acquisition and spoke today on condition of anonymity.\\n\\n\\n**So someone has read my e-mail?**\\n\\nAside from the fact that Google\\'s algorithms crawl your e-mail all the time to target ads at you, \"someone\" within the NSA/FBI/etc may have read your e-mails, *presumably with a proper warrant*.\\n\\n**Should I be outraged?**\\n\\nProbably! But maybe not. President Obama addressed PRISM on Friday and essentially said, \"Don\\'t worry. You can trust us.\"\\n\\n**Is it even legal?**\\n\\nYes, under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 2008 and the Protect America Act of 2007. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper released a statement Thursday night saying that \"Section 702 is a provision of FISA that is designed to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non-U.S. persons located outside the United States. It cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person, or anyone located within the United States.\" FISA was renewed last year by Congress.\\n\\n\\n**How does it work?**\\n\\nEssentially like this: The attorney general issues a secret order to a tech company to hand over access to its servers to the FBI. The FBI then hands that information over to the NSA.\\n\\nThis account matches what CNET has been told by our reliable source:\\n\\n > When the government delivers Section 702 orders, according to a former official, companies \"implement them just as though they would implement a wiretap -- there\\'s no direct access to servers.\" The order has to be for account information or an intercept directed at a specific foreign person, and \"you can\\'t say everyone in Pakistan who searched for \\'X\\'... It still has to be particularized.\"\\n\\nAccording to CNET\\'s source, both the contents of communications and metadata, such as information about who\\'s talking to whom, can be requested.\\n\\n**What\\'s the fallout?**\\n\\nWell, so far respected human rights watchdog Freedom House has downgraded America\\'s freedom ranking. Last time their survey was released, the United States was the second most free country on Earth in terms of Internet freedoms. That position is about to change.\\n\\n**How can I avoid this?**\\n\\nYou can\\'t.\\n\\n**What happens next?**\\n\\nA congressional hearing and an investigation into who leaked it. \"The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans,\" Clapper said in his statement.\\n\\nSo the answer is, nothing much.\\n\\n[Further Reading - DNI PRISM Fact Sheet](_URL_1_)\\n\\n[More - Parts of NSA\\'s PRISM program declassified](_URL_4_)\\n\\n**Edit:** *Removed - Inaccurate* - Not quite right at this point\\n\\n\\n**Edit 2:**  *Removed - Irrelevant*\\n\\n\\n**Edit 3:** /u/spacedawg_ie Posted a relevant video of the [NSA Head - Gen.

Time *isn't* space, space *isn't* time, but the two are connected in interesting ways that means you can't manipulate one without manipulating the other.\\n\\nIt all comes down to one of the main premises of relativity; the speed of light is the same in all reference frames. Once you take that idea and run with it, you need some way to relate different velocity frames given that you can't just add velocities any more of the speed of light will change. It turns out that Lorentz transforms can do that for you. By expressing time and space as a single set of variables (in the notation, we use 4-vectors), you can apply your Lorentz transform and see what happens.\\n\\nWhen you do all the maths and get everything working consistently, you get results like the way time may pass at different rates in different frames. Our intuition also gets nicely mucked up by things like the relativity of simultaneity not actually being real - if two things are simultaneous to one person, another person may see them happen at different times.\\n\\nThis isn't because time *is* a dimension of space, it's because time and space are both related as parts of overall spacetime.

Above very high temperatures (many thousands of degrees Celcius, depending on the element), atoms ionise into nuclei + electrons. Perhaps this is the interpretation you are looking for. However, above exceptionally high temperatures, these particles which form nuclei and electrons literally phase out. Much like how gas can\\'t condense into droplets of water, the vibrations in the particle fields cannot collapse to form what we would call particles.\\n\\nI believe this temperature is ~ 10^15 degrees.

This can be a large part of their job depending on the sorts of fossils they are looking at, and many palaeontologists have much of their academic papers describing what makes certain species that species, or disagreeing with previous publications about the allocation of species status. Dinosaurs actually only represent a small group of vertebrates, itself a small portion of the fossil record. Most of the fossil record is invertebrates, and there can be many many different species of some invertebrate groups.

              " 'Aluminum is produced from an ore called Bauxite, which is a naturally-occurring mixture of several Aluminum compounds as well as impurities of Iron. This ore is crushed and undergoes what is called the \"Bayer Process\" which converts the various compounds into Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3).\\n\\nThe first step of the Bayer Process is to dissolve the aluminum from the bauxite. This is done at high pressure and temperature in a Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH, a strong base) bath. You can add Calcium Carbonate here to help remove the silica (Si) compounds or you can remove them later in the process. The solution is cooled and the solid impurities are removed, leaving you with Sodium Aluminate (NaAlO2) and water.\\n\\nHistorically this cooled solution would then have Carbon Dioxide bubbled through it to create Aluminum Hydroxide (Al(OH)3), but it\\'s more efficient to instead \"seed\" the solution with some Aluminum Hydroxide crystals that you already have, which causes the Aluminum Hydroxide that\\'s in the tank to crystalize too. \\n\\n*But wait,* I hear you say, *I thought we had Sodium Aluminate in the tank?* \\n\\nWell, we did. And we also had Aluminum Hydroxide. Our NaAlO2/H2O solution exists in a natural equilibrium with a solution of Al(OH)3 and NaOH. The equilibrium heavily favors the side with NaAlO2, but once we start crystalizing bits of AL(OH)3 the equilibrium shifts towards them. (This is called Le Chatlier\\'s principle, and I can explain it more if you have more questions about it.)\\n\\nThe last step of the Bayer Process is to heat the Aluminum Hydroxide crystals in order to have them thermally decompose into Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3) and water.\\n\\nOnce we have the Aluminum Oxide, we can put it through another process which is called the \"Hall-Heroult Process.\" This process relies on a mineral called Cryolite, which, if you want to get technical, is Sodium Hexafluoroaluminate or Na3AlF6. You could potentially skip the Sodium Hexafluoroaluminate and just melt your Alumina (another name for Al2O3), but Alumina has a much higher boiling point and Cryolite dissolves aluminum salts and oxides quite well. Another advantage of Cryolite is that it doesn\\'t break down with high heat or electricity, the developers of this process tried using water first but ran into problems with it breaking down into H2 and O2 before any of the aluminum could be isolated. But I digress,\\n\\nOnce you have dissolved your Al2O3 crystals in Cryolite, you can run an electrical current through the solution. This electrical current gives the Oxygen and Aluminum enough energy to convince them to separate and find another thing to bond to. Typically a carbon anode (the \"positive\" side) is used. In the following equations *e^- * refers to an electron.\\n\\nCathode:\\n\\nAl^+3 +3e^-  **-- > **  Al\\n\\nAnode:\\n\\nO^-2  + C  **-- > ** CO + 2e^-\\n\\nSo overall:\\n\\nAl2O3 + 3C  **-- > ** 2Al + 3CO\\n\\nAlthough in practice there\\'s more CO2 produced at the anode than CO, the math isn\\'t quite as simple. Cryolite and Aluminum have very different densities, so it\\'s relatively easy to remove the Aluminum from the molten Cryolite.\\n\\nThat\\'s the primary production (new aluminum) anyway. Secondary production is completely different, and is put simply, just melting down scrap aluminum that has had impurities and paints removed from it. Secondary production is much more efficient than primary production and makes up about 40% of the North American aluminum supply.',\n",
